#Healthometer - An Infant Monitoring System

**📌 Overview**

Healthometer is a smart health monitoring system designed to track the vital health parameters of infants. It ensures real-time monitoring and early detection of potential health issues, allowing parents and healthcare providers to take timely action.

**📌 Objectives**
1. Integrate temperature, pulse rate, and sound sensors into a single IoT device.
2. Develop a real-time monitoring system with alerts for caregivers.
3. Create a cough detection algorithm tailored for infants.
4. Ensure data privacy and security for infant health data.
5. Design a user-friendly interface for caregivers to access health data.
6. To predict respiratory diseases using audio recordings.

**📌 Proposed System**
1. Continuous Monitoring Module
2. Cough Detection Module
3. User Interface Module
4. Data Management Module
5. Firewall Authentication Module
6. ML model predicts Respiratory diseases using audio recordings.
